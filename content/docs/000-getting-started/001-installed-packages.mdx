## What is installed?

The goal of Doxi is to not bound you to your favorite packages. But it still needs some packages to work with. The main packages are:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/)

### Why Next.js?

What a question. It's by far the most used framework for React. Providing SSR, SSG, ISR and much more. Make Doxi your own.

### Why Contentlayer?

This one might not be obvious if you are reading it for the first time. But I guarantee you, that's what you wish you knew already.

Contentlayer validates your `content/docs` files and transforms your content into type-safe JSON. Doxi computes fields such as `readingTime`, `url`, `pathSegments` within the generated document.

In the future, Contentlayer will support other "Content Sources" than `mdx`/`markdown`, like Contentful, Notion,... Let's bet on it!

### Why Tailwind CSS?

It's one of the largest adapted CSS utility frameworks and is known by a large number of people. It helped me to develop Doxi and is just the way to go for fast implementation. Don't think of class names!

Doxi includes [`tailwind-merge`](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge) to effectively merge utility classes without style conflicts. Also, in avoids the fight between `classnames` and `clx`. Just add what you wish.

## What else?

> Check out the [`package.json`](https://github.com/mxkaske/doxi/blob/main/package.json) for all the packages.

### MDX Plugins

Most of the other packages supports transform the content. Doxi uses [rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype) plugins to:

- prettify the code blocks ([`rehype-pretty-code`](https://rehype-pretty-code.netlify.app/))
- add ids with slugs to the headings ([`rehype-slug`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-slug))
- add **#** links to headings ([`rehype-autolink-headings`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-autolink-headings))
