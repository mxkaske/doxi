## Prose

Doxi includes the [`@tailwindcss/typography`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin) package to easily style the markdown content. Besides the default `prose` styles, Doxi modifies basic elements like `prose-em`, `prose-blockquote` to fit the `brand` design.

## MDX Components

By default, Doxi include overwrites for `a` and `pre` HTML tags:

```ts {6,7}
// /src/lib/mdx.tsx
import Link from "@/components/docs/link";
import Pre from "@/components/docs/pre";

export const components = {
  a: Link, // support client side transition `next/link`
  pre: Pre, // add 'copy & paste'-button
  // ...
};
```

Extend the `components` object with your `JSX` Components to make use of it in your `mdx` content.

## Pretty Code Blocks

Big props go to the [`rehype-pretty-code`](https://github.com/atomiks/rehype-pretty-code) library that includes lots of syntax highlighting. Check out the [docs](https://rehype-pretty-code.netlify.app/) to learn more.

Here is a quick overview you can use with Doxi:

- word highlighting
- line highlighting
- number of lines
- themes
