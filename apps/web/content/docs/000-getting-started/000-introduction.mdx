## What is Doxi?

Doxi is a simple way to _not_ start a documentation page from scratch. Instead, it comes with some of the best libraries that makes building a GitHub based CMS **easy**, **typesafe** and **fun**.

Because we don't want to reinvent the wheel, it already installs some opinionated libraries. Learn more about it in [Installed Packages](/docs/getting-started/installed-packages).

> Doxi uses Next.js 13 and the `/app` directory. It comes with the new Router, Server Components and the new Layout system.

It provides you a template design that almost every documentation page uses and that you can customize as you'd like to. **It's just Next.js** - and if you don't fear the new `/app` directory, you are on the right spot.

## How can I use it?

This website, [doxi.vercel.app](https://doxi.vercel.app) is the example of how to use it. For now, you might want to fork it and change the `content/docs` pages to whatever you need. You will also want to read the **features** to understand what benefits come with Doxi.

Remove what you don't need and add what you need. The features have been splitted into `folders` and `files` such that it gives you a simple way to only use what you need.
